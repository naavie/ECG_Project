In order of importance:

1. Related Work Analysis

- Pay attention to OverLeaf template 
- 

2. Pipeline Completion: 

- Update number of layers of 1DCNN to 10 layers

- Update InstanceSelector such that there are is no positive instance function and generate false_instances based on instances that do not correspond

- Use Dataloaders for next training/presentation to Kostia/Semeon

3. Search for analogue models on HuggingFace (for BERT)

- Benchmark 
- Think about the outcomes of the paper when doing this research 

4. Sperteral analysis of ECG signal using Python packages. Or use frequencies to get embeddings (use images of ECG)

- Fourier & Wavelet Spectrograms

5. Extract some punchline/hypothesis

1. Send all models/related code to Kostia for review with document outlining current bugs + areas where help is needed

2. Complete Thesis: 

- Introduction (In progress)
- Related Works (In progress)
- Dataset
- Start Methodology
