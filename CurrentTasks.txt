In order of importance:

2. Learn and implement ClinicalBERT code.

3.
ECGEncoder() -- Input is ECG signal, output is CLinicalBERT embedding of ECG
CLIPModel()  -- Contains ECGEncoder(), ClinicalBERT model and TripletLoss

3. Write train(), fit(), eval() functions or loops for training the 1DCNN model. 

4. Confirm sampling frequency in Hz for normalizing data. 
    - Frequency range for ECGs in PhysioNet Databases is between: [257, 1000] Hz
    - All samples in CODE-15 are 500 Hz

    - 80 or 128 Hz is a good starting point but read literature to gain better understanding.

5. Send all models/related code to Kostia for review

6. Model updates:

- Increase # of layers to 10-12.
- Instead of flattening, consider adaptive average pooling or average max pooling.
- Attention mechanism ; possibly add between fc layers with Softmax

7. Write the following thesis sections (with citations):

- Introduction
- Methodology
- Related Works
- Dataset Overview
