Due to model convergence issues with the original pipeline the new idea is as follows:

1. Convert ECG signals into images of spectrograms (12 channels; 1 image for each lead) 

- The first three leads are most important so use only the first three leads. That means, there should be 3 images (1 for each lead) per each diagnosis/record.


- Find clip with different text encoders on HuggingFace
- Projection layers can be used for ClincalBERT on HuggingFace. 
- Wavelet/Images of ECGs can be used as baseline

2. Prompts can be used to improve accuracy 

3. Rewrite dataset class

- Add spectrogram converter function to dataset class
- Write these images to files and then save files to Google Disk   
- Spectrogram hyperparameters can impact dimensionality (size of image) of the resulting image.
